SPAAN (*Software Program for prediction of Adhesins and Adhesin-like proteins using Neural network*) is originally described in 
[this paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15374866/).

## Dataset description

- `data/adh.fasta` contains 443 proteins sequences, taken from [uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/) searching for `adhesin AND reviewed:yes`
- `data/not_adh.fasta` contains 500 proteins sequences, taken from the first 2 pages of [uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/) searching for `NOT adhesin AND reviewed:yes`
- `data/original_adh_dataset.fasta` and `data/original_negative_dataset.fasta` are the original datasets, used in the [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15374866/), courtesy of [S. Ramachandran](https://sites.google.com/view/ramuigib/home) (one of the authors).
