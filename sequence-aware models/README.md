# SAAC

SAAC (Sequence-Aware Adhesin Classifier) is an attempt to obtain an adhesin classifier which exploits both the extracted features from protein sequences and protein sequences themselves, to reach better results. The model is obtained simply adding an LSTM layer. It is just a test, and here there are the results:
