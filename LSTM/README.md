# LSTM layer

To enhance the performance of the model we added an LSTM layer. 
I am still testing it, but for now we can reach the same accuracy in about 30 epochs. 

This is a test with a fixed number of epochs, learning rate of 0.001,

you can find the code in [this notebook](./LSTM_spaan.ipynb).
